        <a href="https://github.com/jeffhamm/MyDataScienceProfile/find/main">Project 1: EDA Tool With Pandas Profiling and Streamlit </a>
    
   </p>
   <p>
    This program uses pandas profiling with streamlit to help speed up Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
    It allows the user to select either csv or a database as the source of data. EDA is the stage in any data Analytics activities where we examine the
    data in order to identify features that need further probing. It tries to capture the structer, centrality, variance etc of the data in order to advice 
    further investigation.
    </p>
    <p>
        it tries to do, among other things, the following:

        <ul>
            <li>maximize insight into a data set</li>
            <li>uncover underlying structure</li>
            <li>extract important variables</li>
            <li>detect outliers and anomalies</li>
            <li>test underlying assumptions</li>
        </ul>
